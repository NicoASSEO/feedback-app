# Feedback app:

This is a project I built with the help of Traversy Media's React course.

It is a Feedback Application for a fictional service I provide.

It includes adding, deleting, editing reviews, with a mock Backend to simulate 'real data' using json-server.

It is deployed on the following website : https://jovial-puppy-2052ad.netlify.app/ (but it won't load properly because the data is coming from my local db)
